## notes

`26.10.2019`
- added several inbuilt qb-functions
- could not depointer `string` in `Value`
- (this is not allowed in c++ wo copy con.)
- parser does not allow `x` to be both `Id`/ `Fn`
- there can be unstructured goto anywhere
- using string stream makes `s()` convenient
- virtual function called `ins` for insertion
- operator overloading with `ostream`.
- `friend` function used as multiple includes
